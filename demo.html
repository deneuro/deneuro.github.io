Those needs to be used for medical people working to save lives of Americans. Medical protective gear must be reserved for the front-line healthcare workers who are performing those vital services," he said.CDC has recommended that Americans wear a basic cloth or fabric masks that can be either purchased online or simply made at home.However, Trump said he will not follow that guidance."I just don't want to wear one myself, it's a recommendation," he said."Somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, dictators, kings, queens, I don't know, I don't see it for myself," he said.The deadly coronavirus has so far claimed over 7,000 lives in the US and infected over 2,70,000 people.During the press conference, Trump stressed that the new masks guidelines do not replace CDC's guidance on social distancing, including staying at home when possible, standing at least 6 feet apart for a period of time.He also called for practicing hand hygiene.Based on the new available data, CDC said the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity--for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing--even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms.</div></p><p id="37"></p><p id="-1">Probably material that you'd have at home.

I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. And this is their new hoax. I’ve always viewed it as very serious. There was no difference yesterday from days before. I feel the tone is similar, but some people said it wasn’t. We’re — what do you have, a very small number of people in the country right now with it? It’s like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we’re in very good shape. We’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So you’re talking about 2.2 million deaths — 2.2 million people from this. And so if we could hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000 — it’s a horrible number, maybe even less, but to 100,000, so we have between 100,000 and 200,000. We all together have done a very good job. The flu in our country kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me. But that’s a little bit like the flu. It’s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we’ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner. View this the same as the flu. This is not the flu. It’s vicious. It is so contagious. Flu has never been like that, and there is — flu is contagious, but nothing like we’ve ever seen here. Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That’s what — the bottom line. Anybody right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful. And in some cases, they’re in California where we have too many. And then in other cases, the distribution could be a little bit better for certain areas, but we’ve done a good job on testing.”</div></p><p id="40"></p><p id="-1">Medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare workers who are performing those vital services.

It is not illegal for the company to sell its masks to foreign countries. And the U.S. has been slow to respond in a coordinated way or to marshal federal resources, health officials said. That sluggish response has meant that other governments put in orders ahead of the United States.</div></p><p id="42"></p><p id="-1">Again, we're going to all come back together here.  We're going to all come back together.  And practicing hand hygiene, which we should do anyway.

</p><p id="-1">A lot of things, I think, are going to spill over.  Shaking hands maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this.  One of the  one of our great doctors was telling me that  as you know, we have flus every year, and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial.  And said that if they didn't shake hands, that number would be substantially lower.  Maybe some of these things, long term, will be good.  But those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection.

</p><p id="-1">So with the masks, it's going to be, really, a voluntary thing.  You don't have to do it.  I'm choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it, and that's okay.  We're also taking action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any American seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus.  The largest insurer nationwide, the BlueCross BlueShield System, has now announced that it will not require any co-pays  which is really something; that's a tremendous statement  from patients of the virus treatment for the next 60 days, similar to the commitments of Cigna, Humana, Anthem.  Those are great companies, and they're all doing the same thing.  For them to do that is  Today I can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the economic relief package Congress passed last month.  So that was as per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday.  This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment.  So that's, I think, answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people.

</p><p id="-1">I'm also signing a directive invoking the Defense Production Act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers.

</p><p id="-1">The security and Secretary  the Secretary of Homeland Security will work with FEMA to prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment.  We need these items immediately for domestic use.  We have to have them.  But we've done really well with the purchase of items, and you'll be hearing about that shortly.

</p><p id="-1">We've already leveraged the DPA to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies.  Under that authority, this week, the Department of Health and Human Services, working with the Department of Justice, took custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves, as well as bottles  many, many, many bottles  and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded.  All of this material is now being given to healthcare workers.  Most of it has already been given out.  And we've given a lot to New York, a lot in New Jersey, a lot to other places.

</p><p id="-1">In addition to ensure that healthcare workers in New York have the protective equipment they need, the federal government, in the name of the Department of Defense, is providing about 8.1 million N95 respirators.  And we've already given 200,000 of them to New York City.  Mayor de Blasio needed them very badly, so we got them to Mayor de Blasio in New York City.  And they were very grateful.  And we're going to be increasing that number from 8.1 million to more.  That's a lot of N95 respirators.

And no big price hikes, no big anything.  I mean, they've just kept it going.  And now they got hit.  But with all the jobs and all of the good that they do, we're going to make sure that they stay in good shape.

</p><p id="-1">America is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens, our future society.  Our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time.  And we want them to stay healthy for a long time.
