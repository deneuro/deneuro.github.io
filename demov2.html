I'll talk to you later.

Okay, thank you very much, everybody.  And I want to start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of New York as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in America.  That seems to be the hotspot right now.  But you have some others,as you know, that are very  very bad.  Louisiana is getting hit very hard.  Parts of Michigan are getting hit very, very hard.  New Jersey is  is –surprisingly, it's much greater than anybody would have thought.  They're doing a really good job.  The governor is doing a really good job out there.

The volume of calls is endless and the fear is unrelenting.Many medics are afraid to take the virus home."This is the scariest thing I've ever seen," said FDNY Paramedic Travis Kessel. "It's incredibly viral, it's incredibly contagious and we just can't keep up."Ambulances make up much of the traffic these days as they race around the city to save the sick -- with more than 20 percent of their own ranks out sick.At 3 p.m. on Tuesday they hit 4,000 calls which used to be the 24-hour average.It's hitting home at the NYPD too. On Tuesday, 15 percent of the department was out sick , which adds up to roughly 5,600 cops. Of them, nearly 1,200 have tested positive for COVID-19.So far the NYPD has lost five public servants."It's a stressful job at the best of times, I don't think you can imagine a more stressful time, but we're carrying on, you gotta take care of yourself," said NYC Police Commissioner Dermot Shea.Local first responders are getting help. On Tuesday, the first of 250 ambulances pulled in from across the country -- staffed with 500 medics to help pick up the slack.The partnership between FEMA and the city is expected to improve medical call response times.But that won't step the fear. Paramedic John Rubin hasn't seen his son in days."Last night he asked me, he said, 'when you gonna come, come get me,' I told him 'when everybody stops getting sick or they stop going to heaven,'" Rubin said.</div>They're the best in the world.  We will take every action and we'll spare no resource  financial, medical, scientific.  We will not spare anything.  We'll get it back into shape.

Recommends Wearing Masks in Public; Trump Says, ‘I’m Choosing Not to Do It’</div><a class="indent c42" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html">https://www.nytimes.com</a><div class="indent c42">“Have you been briefed by the C.D.C.?” “I have.” “Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?” “No, we’re not at all, and we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine. I’ve always known this is a real — this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. And this is their new hoax. I’ve always viewed it as very serious. There was no difference yesterday from days before. I feel the tone is similar, but some people said it wasn’t. We’re — what do you have, a very small number of people in the country right now with it? It’s like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we’re in very good shape. We’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So you’re talking about 2.2 million deaths — 2.2 million people from this. And so if we could hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000 — it’s a horrible number, maybe even less, but to 100,000, so we have between 100,000 and 200,000. We all together have done a very good job. The flu in our country kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me. But that’s a little bit like the flu. It’s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we’ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner. View this the same as the flu. This is not the flu. It’s vicious. It is so contagious. Flu has never been like that, and there is — flu is contagious, but nothing like we’ve ever seen here. Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That’s what — the bottom line. Anybody right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful. And in some cases, they’re in California where we have too many. And then in other cases, the distribution could be a little bit better for certain areas, but we’ve done a good job on testing.”</div><div class="indent c42" style="font-weight: bold">White House Debates How Far to Go on Face Mask Guidelines</div><a class="indent c42" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/world/coronavirus-live-news-updates.html">https://www.nytimes.com</a><div class="indent c42">Even as the U.S. grapples with a mask shortage, 3M has continued to sell the critical safety equipment abroad, according to someone with direct knowledge of the matter. It is not illegal for the company to sell its masks to foreign countries. And the U.S. has been slow to respond in a coordinated way or to marshal federal resources, health officials said. That sluggish response has meant that other governments put in orders ahead of the United States.</div>Again, we're going to all come back together here.  We're going to all come back together.  And practicing hand hygiene, which we should do anyway.

A lot of things, I think, are going to spill over.  Shaking hands maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this.  One of the  one of our great doctors was telling me that  as you know, we have flus every year, and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial.  And said that if they didn't shake hands, that number would be substantially lower.  Maybe some of these things, long term, will be good.  But those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection.

So with the masks, it's going to be, really, a voluntary thing.  You don't have to do it.  I'm choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it, and that's okay.  We're also taking action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any American seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus.  The largest insurer nationwide, the BlueCross BlueShield System, has now announced that it will not require any co-pays  which is really something; that's a tremendous statement  from patients of the virus treatment for the next 60 days, similar to the commitments of Cigna, Humana, Anthem.  Those are great companies, and they're all doing the same thing.  For them to do that is  Today I can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the economic relief package Congress passed last month.  So that was as per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday.  This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment.  So that's, I think, answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people.

I'm also signing a directive invoking the Defense Production Act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers.

The security and Secretary  the Secretary of Homeland Security will work with FEMA to prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment.  We need these items immediately for domestic use.  We have to have them.  But we've done really well with the purchase of items, and you'll be hearing about that shortly.

We've already leveraged the DPA to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies.  Under that authority, this week, the Department of Health and Human Services, working with the Department of Justice, took custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves, as well as bottles  many, many, many bottles  and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded.  All of this material is now being given to healthcare workers.  Most of it has already been given out.  And we've given a lot to New York, a lot in New Jersey, a lot to other places.

In addition to ensure that healthcare workers in New York have the protective equipment they need, the federal government, in the name of the Department of Defense, is providing about 8.1 million N95 respirators.  And we've already given 200,000 of them to New York City.  Mayor de Blasio needed them very badly, so we got them to Mayor de Blasio in New York City.  And they were very grateful.  And we're going to be increasing that number from 8.1 million to more.  That's a lot of N95 respirators.

Today, my team spoke with the CEO of Ochsner Health and the CEO of LCMC, the two largest health systems in New Orleans.  They said they feel that they currently have enough ventilators  <a onclick="openDIV('c93')" style="text-decoration: underline" href="#">I think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilators  and masks, and appreciate what we did and all of the things we've been doing with them, working with them.

The US till Friday reported 7,380 deaths and at least 276,500 infections due to the deadly coronavirus, the highest for any country in the world."We are expanding the role of the Armed Forces in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war of the United States military, and we are in a war. Invisible enemy," Trump told reporters during a press briefing, as he described New York as the hotspot of this war.On Friday, the number of those infected by COVID-19 in the New York state alone crossed 100,000 and the deaths touched 3,000. Its neighbouring New Jersey followed up with nearly 30,000 infections and 646 deaths. Members of the White House task force on coronavirus expect the deadly disease to peak in the next 10 days.Various models have predicted between 100,000 to 200,000 deaths in the next few months, during which a large number of people are likely to be infected. As such, the administration would require thousands of new hospital beds and ventilators along with face masks and other medical supplies.Overall, the US on Friday in a single day added more than 33,000 new COVID-19 cases, taking the total to 276,500. In just one day, more than 1,550 Americans lost their lives, taking the fatalities to over 7,380.Over 90 per cent of the country's 330 million population are under strict stay-in-home order and major disaster declaration has been announced for over three dozen States."Our hearts go out to the people of New York as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in America. That seems to be the hot spot right now, but you have some others as you know that are very, very bad," Trump said during the briefing at the White House."Louisiana is getting hit very hard. Parts of Michigan are getting hit very, very dark. New Jersey is surprisingly it's much greater than anybody would have thought they are doing a really good job," he said.The Javits Convention Centre in New York that has been converted overnight into a 2,500 beds hospital by the army would now be manned by the armed forces as well, he said. ,"Over 9,000 retired army medical personnel have answered their nation's call and are now supporting field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country, he said.The Army Corps of Engineers has assessed more than 100 facilities in all 50 states, he said.They are rapidly building temporary hospitals and alternative care sites in many states in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Ohio, Trump added.He said the National Guard members have been activated to hold states build new treatment centers and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supplies."The National Guard is assisting very strongly because the states were, in many cases, unable to have the delivery capability from warehouses and other places that they put the supplies," he said.In addition to ensure that healthcare workers in New York have the protective equipment the need the federal government, the Department of Defense is providing about 8.1 million respirators.The Department of Health and Human Services is working with the Department of Justice and has taken the custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves as well as many bottles and disinfectant sprays.</div><div class="indent c113" style="font-weight: bold">Donald Trump expands role of US army in fight against coronavirus</div><a class="indent c113" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/donald-trump-expands-role-of-us-army-in-fight-against-coronavirus/articleshow/74978588.cms">https://economictimes.indiatimes.com</a><div class="indent c113">US President Donald Trump has expanded the role of the US Army in the fight against the deadly coronavirus , saying that no one is better prepared to fight the current situation which is like a war.

But they're doing some job.  The Army Corps of Engineers  what a job they're doing.  And FEMA  what a job they're doing.

As we deploy the power of our military, we're also deploying the skill of our doctors, scientists, and medical researchers.  We continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies, and the treatment and prevention of the virus.  And we will keep the American people fully informed on our findings.  I don't know, it's looking like it's having some good results.  I hope that  that would be a phenomenal thing.

But we have it right now in  approximately now, it's increased to 1,500 people.  I spoke with Dr. Zucker in New York  terrific guy, by the way.  we're doing a good job.  And I spoke to Governor Cuomo last evening and this morning about it.  So it's been there for about three and a half days, but I think  and many other places it's being tested too.  And we have a tremendous supply of it.  We've ordered it in the case that it works.  it could have some pretty big impacts.  And we'll see what happens.

My administration is also working to get relief to American workers and businesses.  On day one of the Paycheck Protection Program, as Kevin said, more than $3.5.billion in guaranteed loans have been processed to help small businesses keep their workers employed during the unprecedented time  this unprecedented time.

The energy industry has been especially hard hit in the crisis.  This afternoon, I met with Greg Garland of Phillips 66, Dave Hager of Devon Energy, Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp Energy, Vicki Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners, Mike Wirth of Chevron, and Darren Woods of Exxon Mobil.  I informed them that we will be making space available in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to let American producers store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time.

There's a tremendous abundance of oil, primarily because of the virus.  The virus has just stopped demand of everything, including oil.  So we're working with our great energy companies.  They employ tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.  And they've kept America really going for a long time.  And no big price hikes, no big anything.  I mean, they've just kept it going.  And now they got hit.  But with all the jobs and all of the good that they do, we're going to make sure that they stay in good shape.

America is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens, our future society.  Our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time.  And we want them to stay healthy for a long time.  You'll see some bad thingsand then you're going to see some really good things.  And it's not going to be too long.

We will heal our citizens and we will care for our neighbors, and we will unleash the full might of the United States of America to vanquish the virus.

And with that, I'd like to ask Mike Pence to come up, Vice President, and say a few words.  And we'll have a couple of other quick talks on a couple of subjects, and we'll take questions.

And it's a beautiful Friday in Washington, D.C., and our country is a great place, and we're getting better.  We're getting better very quickly.

We just said  they said, "Close it down.  You have to close it down."  We closed it down and we're healing.  We're going to get it better fast.

So, Mike, if you could come up say a few words.  </div></section>
